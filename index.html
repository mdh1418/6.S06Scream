<h1><b>Project Name:</b> 6.S06Scream</h><br>
<h2><b>Team Members:</b> Xin Wen, Mitchell Hwang</h>

<br><br>


<h3>Our idea</h3>
Stressed? Think you’re more stressed than a friend? Find out by using our 6.S06Scream Canister, which is modeled after those in Disney’s film Monsters, Inc.

<h3>How it works</h3>
As shown in the film, our 6.S06Scream Canister will register and record screams. To do so, simply project your voice into the nozzle of the device. When finished, the device will record and upload your scream in the form of dB and duration.

<pre>
This index.html was placed in your home directory when your account
was created.  Without this file, anyone accessing your home directory
on the web would see a listing of your files, but would NOT be able to
access their contents.

If you choose to create a website on Athena, you'll need to put its
contents in the "www" subdirectory in your account, and give out a URL
including the "www" directory.  For example, if your username is
"joeuser", you should give out the following URL to anyone wishing to
visit your website: http://web.mit.edu/joeuser/www/

Before creating a website or removing this file, we strongly encourage
you to read up on AFS Permissions in our knowledge base at
http://kb.mit.edu.
