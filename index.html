<h3>Project Ideas</h3> 
6.S06Scream Canister
<!--
Stressed? Think you’re more stressed than a friend? Find out by using our 6.S06Scream Canister, which is modeled after those in Disney’s film Monsters, Inc.

<h3>How it works</h3>
-->
    <p>Stressed? Try our 6.S06Scream Canister, which is modeled after those in Disney’s film Monsters, Inc. As shown in the film, our 6.S06Scream Canister will register and record screams. To do so, simply project your voice into the nozzle of the device. When finished, the device will record and upload your scream in the form of dB and duration to a cloud platform and you can compete with your friends to see who's more stressed. It will be a playful way to destress from your daily hustle-and-bustle. </p>

Smart Stroller 
    <p>It's hard to have a new-born. When you go out for a walk with your adorable baby, it's already troublesome enough to carry all the things and make sure the baby is content. Having to adjust the stroller cover and seat is just too much work. THe smart stroller will detect its surrounding brightness and automatically adjust the cover position. If we have time, we also want to automate changing seat configuration (i.e. chaning between inclined and flat).</p>

Tangible Game 
    <p>We want to take popular games out of the computer screens and let players interact with the game and with each other with their full body instead of a mouse cursor. Games will be projected onto a wall and players need to interact with projected images, e.g. catch a target or follow some movements. A camera behind the player will use computer vision to determine how accurately the player completes the task. This will encourage players to be more active and allow more interactions among the players. </p>
